Prompt > expand & ask questions > reply questions > define market hypothesis > generate artifacts > generate code > deploy

- it can be both a top down solution and a bottom up (the user can come with the solution already or just talk about the problem and the AI interact over creating a solution)

Frameworks
- pretotyping
  the user could be able to select different frameworks that will generate different documents

- The main point about bootstrapping is to get to market as fast as possible in order to not create too many propositions in the head distancing itself from the market. As soon as you turn your thoughts into something that is visible, by yourself and others, it'll be possible to test market and those questions can be responded:


- We help our users stop having ideas and start creating a product, service or saas

bootstrapp is a pre-prototyping too. It is the tool that makes you go from 0 to 1 and beat the inertia.

Bootstrapp is your best tool to start talking with potential customers right now

1. bootstrapp a prompt > 
2. make questions to expand the understanding > who are the users? -> what is the essence of their dissatisfaction? -> what are we building for them?
3. propose smallest hypothesis to test >
4. Select pretotyping type
5. Generate artefacts to test hypothesis
6. collect data and respond to the quetions:
   - Will people be interested in it?
   - Will they use it the way we expect?
   - Will it solve their problem?
   - Will they use it more than once?
   - Can we build it?
   - Will it work functionally?
   - How much will it cost to build it?
   - How much time will it take?
7. bootstrapp a new prompt for the same project or refactor current one based on data collected
8. Or go build a prototype if the idea was validated


- We can give the user analytics that will help him make decisions

a prototyping validates if a product can be built technically while a pretotyping validates if there is demand for a prototype to be built 


## bootstrApp Workflow and Key Features

1. **Capture User Prompt**: Accepts a user input in the form of a brief description of their product idea, or a specific problem they'd like to solve.

2. **Expand Understanding**: bootstrApp asks additional questions to the user, enhancing its understanding of the project and helping refine the user's idea.

3. **Define Market Hypotheses**: Based on the initial prompt and subsequent questioning, bootstrApp proposes the smallest viable hypotheses to test in the market. 

4. **Framework Selection**: bootstrApp offers the ability for users to choose from various frameworks (including Pretotyping). Each framework guides the subsequent steps and influences the types of documents and artifacts created.

5. **Generate Artifacts**: Based on the selected framework, bootstrApp generates a variety of artifacts (documents, code, prototypes, etc.) to assist in hypothesis testing.

6. **Generate Code**: If necessary, bootstrApp will also generate the initial code base to provide a starting point for development.

7. **Deploy**: bootstrApp can assist in the deployment of the created artifacts, offering the user a tangible product for testing.

8. **Data Collection and Evaluation**: bootstrApp aids in the collection of data post-deployment to help answer essential questions like user interest, usage patterns, problem-solving capacity, repeatability of use, feasibility of development, functional success, cost estimations, and project timelines.

9. **Iteration or Refactoring**: Based on the data collected, users can choose to bootstrap a new prompt for the same project (iterate), or refactor the current prompt to align better with the collected data.

## bootstrApp Positioning

BootstrApp is positioned as both a top-down and bottom-up solution. Users can approach the tool with a fully fleshed-out idea (top-down), or just an initial concept or problem statement (bottom-up). In both cases, bootstrApp's AI interacts to help shape a market-ready solution.

BootstrApp's main objective is to enable users to bring their ideas to market as swiftly as possible. It helps to bridge the gap between ideation and actual product development, beating the inertia that usually accompanies the early stages of a project.

As a pre-prototyping tool, bootstrApp assists users in the journey from zero to one, enabling them to move beyond mere ideation into tangible product creation. It aligns with the Pretotyping methodology, encouraging the testing of hypotheses in real-market conditions and promoting continuous learning and iteration. This iterative process forms the heart of the bootstrApp experience, providing a clear path from idea inception to product deployment and refinement.
